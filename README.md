# SPRING RESTFUL API
I am currently learning to create APIs with SpringBoot so I built this, a simple concept based in users that can store products that they sell, this products can be asociated to pre created categories.

## Features
- Spring MVC Pattern.
- Data Transfer Object Pattern.
- Inversion of control.
- Dependency injection.
- Spring Security and JWT based authorization.
- CRUD for different entyties. For example: admins are be able to se the full list of users and remove them or add/remove the rol ADMIN to any user. A normal user can register (create) his user, login and then edit its profile, also delet their own profile.
- Password encryption with BCrypt.
- Implementation of authorization with roles.


## What is coming...
- I'll try to add more funciontalities to this.
- A frontend page with ANGULAR to make it more cool (working on it, pretty basic just to make the frontend conection and functionalities, not focused on style or looks).
- Unit Testing with Junit and Mockito.
- A propper documentation.
- OAtuh2.
- Products CRUD incoming. Filter by category.
