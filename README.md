# SPRING RESTFUL API
I am currently learning to create APIs with SpringBoot so I built this, a simple concept based in users that can store products that they sell, this products can be asociated to pre created categories.

## Features
- Spring MVC Pattern.
- Data Transfer Object Pattern.
- Inversion of control.
- Dependency injection.
- Spring Security with Role and JWT based authorization.
- CRUD for different entyties.
- Password encryption with BCrypt.

## What is coming...
- I'll try to add more funciontalities to this, even maybe a frontend page to make it more cool.
- Unit Testing with Junit and Mockito.
- A propper documentation.
- OAtuh2.
